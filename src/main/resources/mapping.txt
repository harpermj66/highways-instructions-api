under resources/com/atkins there are a series of xml configuration files directories to use to generate entities.
Files beginning with <ServiceForm> contain <servicecomponent> elements which have a properties:
"table" where the suffix is the table name.
"idref" which is the name of the primary key
"componentpropertiesfn" which is the name of a file which contains more of the entity details.
"masteridref" which if has non zero string value refers to the "idref" of the top most in the file <servicecomponent> that is it's parent in terms of entity hierarchy. A concrete example of this is in Job_Instructions.xml where <servicecomponent title="Job Instruction" idref="JI_ID" ... would be the parent entity of <servicecomponent title="Risk Assessment SORs" masteridref="JI_ID" ..> where the @OneToMany relationship would be generated in the JobInstruction entity
isView" if equals yes sbould be ignored.

Parse the files and create entities and relationships as indicated by the above information

files specified by "componentpropertiesfn" have within the <labelfield> element more field names where properties:
"fname" is the field name,
"ftype" is the database field type, ie. String. If ftype is "Number" then precision and scale can by used to side the database field.
"nullable" refers to nullability
